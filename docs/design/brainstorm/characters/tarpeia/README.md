# Tarpeia

Tarpeia is a legendary-historical priestess who lived in Rome shortly after its
founding. She was executed for betraying the Romans to the neighboring tribe of
Sabines.

## What History Says

[Tarpeia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarpeia)
[Tarpeian Rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarpeian_Rock)

History says Tarpeia was one of the very first residents of Rome. She was a
Vestal who betrayed her father and early Rome to the Sabines--a tribe with a
significant settlement on a hill to the northeast.

There are variations on the exact story, but the Romans believed that, shortly
after the founding of the Rome, in the final battle following the mass
kidnapping of women from neighboring towns (see
[Rape of the Sabines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rape_of_the_Sabine_Women)
and [Raptio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raptio)), Tarpeia allowed Sabine
soldiers into the newly constructed citadel on the Capitoline Hill, where the
non-combatants, including the captured Sabine women, were hiding. Romulus had
charged Tarpeia's father with defending this citadel, making her betrayal of
Rome also a betrayal of her father.

After the Sabines secured access to the citadel, Tarpeia sought her payment--the
jewelry the Sabine fighters were known for wearing on their left arms. Instead,
they crushed her using their shields, which they also wore on the left arms.
Accounts vary on her precise fate, but in all of them she's crushed and killed.

In some accounts, she--or perhaps, just her corpse--was thrown off of an 80ft
cliff on the Capitoline Hill. In other versions she's buried either at the base
of it or near the precipice. Whatever her exact fate, the cliff now bears her
name--the Tarpeian Rock.

For hundreds of years, the Roman state executed traitors and other criminals by
throwing them off this rock.

## Existing Stories

### Roman Legend

The Romans told the story of Tarpeia for hundreds of years. Over 700 years
later, as he consolidated his power to create the office of Emperor Augustus
ordered the minting of coins with his face on one side and an image of Tarpeia
on the other:

[The Sacrilege of Tarpeia](https://coinsweekly.com/The-sacrilege-of-Tarpeia--or-propaganda-under-Augustus/)

By appearing on a coin with Tarpeia, Augustus made further use of her story in
order to communicate:

- I am powerful enough to order coins with my face it.

- I am as much part of Rome and its history as its foundational myths.

- I am happy to be associated with Rome's long tradition of severely punishing
  traitors.

To the Romans, Tarpeia's story illustrated some of their key foundational
values--obedience to father and state--and the capital punishment that follows
when those values are betrayed. The fact that it was the Sabines who executed
her tells us that even though they benefited from the betrayal, they felt the
same disgust towards treachery as the Romans did. After all, shortly afterwards,
the Sabines became Romans.

The Romans cast Tarpeia as unambiguously guilty and worthy of being crushed and
thrown off of a cliff. A quick summary:

- Tarpeia betrayed the city in its earliest days.

- Even worse, she betrayed her father, causing him to fail in his obligation to Romulus.

- Even even worse, Tarpeia was driven by greed, asking for the jewelry on Sabine's
  left arms in exchange for access to the citadel.

- Even even even worse, Tarpeia's (supposed) greed also is incongruous with her
  role as a Vestal. The Romans deeply valued piety and the resultant positive
  relationship with the gods. State treachery from anybody was bad, but from a
  priestess of Vesta? Very irreligious and potentially offensive to the gods!

She's the ideal traitor, which ought to inspire some skepticism about these
accounts. Moreover, it's noteworthy that her crimes are bad enough that the
Sabines feel free to ignore the physical protections that Vestals are supposed
to have.

In fact, because the story of Tarpeia is a tool for communicating and enforcing
Roman values, it's valuable to speculate about who she actually was with a
*very* skeptical eye on the Roman legend.

## New Story Ideas

What kinds of stories could we tell about Tarpeia?

This covers how the Romans saw her along with some ideas for stories you could
tell about her.

### Tarpeia is Righteous

Stepping back, and applying some skepticism to the legend, it's not difficult to
sympathize with Tarpeia.

Here are some elements of a defense of her:

#### Rome is baby

Rome is very young at the time. The legend takes place perhaps, a couple of
years after Rome's foundation. In fact, it'd be surprising if the citadel and
its fortifications were even "done" or in a very mature state at this time.

In fact, Tarpeia's Rome was a novel, problematic, and dubious experiment in
city-founding. Tarpeia certainly had other older--even perhaps sacred--things in
her life:

- Tarpeia's oath to Vesta and obligations to that order/college

- The nearby Sabine settlement

- The Sabine families culture and history

- Other older cities in the Latin League (such as Lavinium and Alba Longa),
  which perhaps already had their own epic, legendary founding stories.

In Tarpeia's world, even a well-behaved Rome would be a new
settlement-experiment and might be appropriately below other priorities.

#### Rome is sketch

Upon founding the city, wishing to quickly attract a meaningfully sized
population Romulus presented Rome as an Asylum for criminals and other
undesirables.

In fact, it is because the Roman population had such an abundance of single men,
who neighboring settlements deemed unsuitable to marriage for their daughters,
that the Roman's rationalized kidnapping women from neighboring towns.

Why would it be correct for Tarpeia to remain loyal to a city whose inhabitants
who behave so poorly? When they didn't get the answer they wanted, they used
deception and force and the umbrage a religious of a festival to kidnap the
women en mass.

#### Tarpeia's Obligations to Father and Country

[Vestal Virgin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestal_Virgin)

As a Vestal, she's likely in the middle of some part of a 30-year vow to be the
to serve Vesta, not Rome or even her father.

The subsequent Roman version of the Vestal college, established by Romulus's
successor Numa, links the piety of the Vestals to the health of the state.
Perhaps the Romans created the college in a way designed to resolve any conflict
or ambiguity in loyalty.

#### Tarpeia's Obligations to Vesta--Home, Hearth, and Family

Vesta is the goddess of the hearth, home, and family. Through ceremonies and
rites, Vestals provide concrete services, such as maintaining a sacred fire from
which ordinary people could light their hearths. They also perform several
abstract religious functions, ensuring that the gods, Vesta in particular, will
bless the associated households.

To ordinary people in central Italy, Rome's kidnapping of the Sabine women was
terrifying and unacceptable. As a Vestal, Tarpeia must have found their
disregard for Home, Hearth and Family as not just wrong, but a sacrilegious
betrayal of fundamental values.
