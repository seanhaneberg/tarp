# Tarpeia

Tarpeia is a mytho-historical preistess who lived in Rome shortly after its
founding. She was executed for betrayed the Romans to the neighboring tribe of
Sabines.

## What History Says

History says Tarpeia was one of the very first residents of Rome. She was a
Vestal who betrayed her father and early Rome to the Sabines--a tribe with a
significant settlment on a hill to the northeast.

There are variations on the exact story, but the Romans believed that, shortly
after the founding of the Rome, in the final battle following the Rape of the
Sabines, Tarpiea allowed Sabine soliders into the new citadel on the Capitoline
Hill, where the non-combatant population of Rome hid. Romulus had charged
Tarpiea's father with defending this citadel, making her betrayal of Rome also a
betrayal of her father.

After the Sabines secured access to the citadel, and Tarpeia sought her
payment--the jewelery the Sabine soldiers wore on their left arms--they crushed
her by piling their shields on her. Ultimately, she was thrown off of an 80ft
cliff on the Capitoline Hill which now bears her name--the Tarpeian Rock.

She would be the first to be executed in this manner. For hundreds of years
subsequently, the Roman state executed traitors and other criminals by throwing
them off this rock.

## Story Ideas

What kinds of stories could we tell about Tarpeia?

This covers how the Romans saw her along with some ideas for stories you could
tell about her.

### Tarpeia to the Romans

To the Romans, Tarpeia's story illustrated some of their key foundational
values--obedience to father and state--and the capital punishment that follows
when those values are betrayed. The fact that it was the Sabines who executed
her tells us that even though they benefited from the betrayal, they had the
same values. After all, shortly afterwards, the Sabines became Romans.

The Romans cast Tarpeia as unambigously guilty and worhty of being crushed and
thrown off of a cliff. A quick summary:

- Tarpeia betrayed the city in its earliest days.

- Even worse, she betrayed her father, causing him to fail in his obligation to Romulus.

- Even even worse, Tarpeia was driven by greed, asking for the jewelry on Sabine's
  left arms in exchange for access to the citadel.

- Even even even wrose, Tarpeia's (supposed) greed also is incongruous with her
  role as a preistess. The Romans deeply valued piety and the resultant positive
  relationship with the gods. State treachery from anybody was bad, but from a
  priestess of Vesta? Very irreligious and potentially offensive to the gods!

### Tarpeia is Righteous
