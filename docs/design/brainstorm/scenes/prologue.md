# Prologue

## Purpose

This scene is meant to foreshadow the climax of the game while also telling the
story of Tarpeia as history remembers it.

In fact, the prologue should allow the player to think the worst of Tarpeia, in
keeping with traditional tellings.

The prologue covers Tarpeia's offer to the Sabines up until she is thrown off the cliff.

Birds fly up from below as she falls, but the prologue ends before she lands and
we flash back to the beginning of the story.

## Framing

The Prologue's presentation ought to be different than the rest of the game,
perhaps involving an objective narrative voice that only appears again at the
end.

This presents distinct narrative "bookends" to the story while also leveraging
an objective voice to quickly set the context. It should feel like a story is
being told.

Pretty sure this is a common trick/trope. ;-)

## Narrative Beats

The following points have to be hit in a prologue about Tarpeia.

### It's a Roman Legend about the Founding

### Greed

### Lust

### Betrayal of Father

### Betrayal of State

### Tarpeian Rock
