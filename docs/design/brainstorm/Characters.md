History says Tarpeia was one of the very first residents of Rome. She was a
Vestal who betrayed her father and early Rome to the Sabines--a tribe with a
significant settlment on a hill to the northeast.

There are variations on the exact story, but the Romans believed that, shortly
after the founding of the Rome, in the final battle following the Rape of the
Sabines, Tarpiea allowed Sabine soliders into the new citadel on the Capitoline
Hill, where the non-combatant population of Rome hid. Romulus had charged
Tarpiea's father with defending this citadel, making her betrayal of Rome also a
betrayal of her father.

After the Sabines secured access to the citadel, and Tarpeia sought her
payment--the jewelery the Sabine soldiers wore on their left arms--they crushed
her by piling their shields on her. Ultimately, she was thrown off of an 80ft
cliff on the Capitoline Hill which now bears her name--the Tarpeian Rock.

She would be the first to be executed in this manner. For hundreds of years
subsequently, the Roman state executed traitors and other criminals by throwing
them off this rock.
